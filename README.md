In our project we have implemented two methods for dns security

1. DNS CRYPT
			here we have used python based encryption method to encrypt the hostname at packet level and for security purpose in response we are giving fake ip address and hostname to misguide the attacker
		
2. DNS OVER HTTPS
			In this method we are using trained machine learning  model to classify the data with doh and non doh and then malicious or bening , which will stop the dns tunneling attack
			
more details regarding both implementation are in their respective folders
